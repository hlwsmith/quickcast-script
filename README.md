# quickcast-script

This is a bash shell script that helps with ffmpeg command line
invocation. It can save a screencast to a file or make a livecast to
YouTube.com or Twitch.tv. Very rough around the edges but perhaps the
source would be useful to others trying to figure out how to use
ffmpeg to stream live content.

I'll put some more info here eventually ;-)
